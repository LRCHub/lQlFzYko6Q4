I've got this feelin' that I've been here before

Nobody can bend the up and down
As long as you understand
The long undertow
The others can hold their breath so long
So long as they understand
The long undertow

I've got this feelin' that I've been here before

Nobody can bend the up and down
As long as you understand
The long undertow
The others can hold their breath so long
So long as they understand
The long undertow

This couldn't be more ghetto
You and your daughters and their eyes

I've got this feelin' that I've been here before
